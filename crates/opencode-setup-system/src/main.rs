//! The OpenCode setup system.
//!
//! This file is the harness's *facts*. Every command over them lives in
//! [`harness_runtime`], shared with the other setup systems, so a change to
//! behaviour lands once and a change to OpenCode's surface lands here.
//!
//! Unlike its siblings, this harness's routes were not read off the product's
//! documentation alone: `ai-stp` already carries a composition table for
//! `opencode`, and the namespaces below are that table. Where a consumer has
//! already decided where a component goes, agreeing with it is not a shortcut --
//! disagreeing would make every bundle it sends land somewhere it will not look.
